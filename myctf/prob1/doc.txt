Problem setup: 
Daedelus IT recommends Bftpd to employees- it is a secure, easy to set up 
server that people can use at home.  Police discovered your dad running
Bftpd at your house, can you help us login? 

Solution
Provide a username that consists of:
  <shell code> 
+ "%<padding>x"    // Junk for syslog and ebp
+ <&syslog>>	   // Return to the shell code

Concept being taught:
This problem highlights the power of format strings.  Although the buffer size
is fixed, the student can take advantage of sprintf and abuse format 
strings.  The problem forces the student to create a string that is less than
64 characters, but when interpreted by sprintf, overflows the buffer.

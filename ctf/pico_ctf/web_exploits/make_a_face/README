*** Make a face ***

* Tips *
- the extension after index.cgi suggests there's more on the server that can be directly accessed
	- curl "http://makeaface.picoctf.com/index.cgi?Head=4.bmp&Hair=2.bmp&Nose=2.bmp&Mouth=2.bmp&Eyes=2.bmp"
- view page source code: the unsafe syscalls are open/read
	- search for "perl injections with open"
	- anything to the left of "|" will be executed as a command

* Steps *
- we want to launch a shell, so use curl to access the webpage
- note the line: open(HEAD,"head".$q->param('Head'));
	- head is concatenated with whatever parameter is in the url
	- we can resubmit the request via curl and modify the url, thus getting:
		- curl "http://makeaface.picoctf.com/index.cgi?Head=4.bmp&Hair=2.bmp&Nose=2.bmp&Mouth=2.bmp&Eyes=ls |"
- there are a few things wrong the modified request above:
	- "eyes" is concatenated with the parameter so we need a ; to separate commands
	- the modified string is not url encoded
	- we need this for every parameter because the end result is & together
- ultimately we see the file "Secret....", we need to replace "ls" with "cat *" to see what's in it

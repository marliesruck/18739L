*** Towers of Toast ***

* Tips *
- they give you the src, so there answer is there (as opposed to being on
  a server and needing to coerce it out)

Method 1:
- understand the prime factorization going on
- multiply the first 40 primes in wolfram-alpha
- one tower is this product, the other two towers are 1

Method 2:
- change the source code to generate a game that wins
- select 'new' and then instead of randomly distributing the discs 
  modify the code to only distribute them to one tower
